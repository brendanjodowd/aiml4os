<h1>Downloading and visualising malaria data with <code>malariaAtlas</code></h1>
<p>This tutorial shows how to use the <code>malariaAtlas</code> package to download, visualize and manipulate global malaria data hosted by the <a href="https://malariaatlas.org/">Malaria Atlas Project</a>. These data can be explored and downloaded interactively at <a href="https://malariaatlas.org/explorer/#/">data explorer</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>malariaAtlas</code> package enables users to download three types of data:</p>
<ul>
<li>parasite rate (PR) survey data (<em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> and <em>Plasmodium vivax</em>)</li>
<li>vector occurrence data</li>
<li>administrative boundary shapefiles to visualise data</li>
<li>rasters covering a range of modelled outputs related to malaria research such as predicted malaria parasite prevalence</li>
</ul>
<div id="installation-of-malariaatlas-package" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation of <code>malariaAtlas</code> package</h2>
<p>The <code>malariaAtlas</code> package can be installed from CRAN and loaded as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;malariaAtlas&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(malariaAtlas)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="checking-available-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Checking available data</h2>
<p>The <code>malariaAtlas</code> package provides users with a convenient API to interact with the publicly available malaria data hosted by the Malaria Atlas Project. The <code>listData()</code> function helps retrieve a list of all the available data which can be downloaded, and is a wrapper for <code>listPoints()</code>, <code>listRaster()</code> and <code>listShp()</code>. We can find all countries that have PR survey points data with <code>listData(datatype = "pr points")</code>, and all countries with vector occurrence data with <code>listData(datatype = "vector points")</code>. We can also see raster data available with <code>listData(datatype = "raster")</code>, and shapefiles available with <code>listData(datatype = "shape")</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>isAvailable_pr()</code> function can be used to check whether a specified country or location has PR survey points. Similarly, <code>isAvailable_vec()</code> checks whether a specified country or location has vector occurrence data. For example, we can check whether Zimbabwe has PR survey points and India has vector occurrence data as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>isAvailable_pr(country = &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;)
isAvailable_vec(country = &quot;India&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="dowloading-and-visualising-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Dowloading and visualising data</h2>
<div id="pr-survey-data" class="section level3">
<h3>PR survey data</h3>
<p>The <code>getPR()</code> function downloads all the publicly available PR points for a country (or countries) and returns it as a dataframe. The <code>species</code> argument is a string specifying the Plasmodium species and can be <code>Pf</code>, <code>Pv</code> or <code>BOTH</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ZM_PR_data &lt;- getPR(country = &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;, species = &quot;BOTH&quot;)</code></pre>

<h3>Modelled Rasters</h3>
<p>The <code>getRaster()</code> function downloads publicly available rasters for a specific surface and year, clipped to a given bounding box or shapefile. For example we can download Plasmodium falciparum PR2-10 for Zimbabwe in 2010 as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ZM_shp &lt;- getShp(country = &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;, admin_level = &quot;admin0&quot;)
ZMB_Pf &lt;- getRaster(surface = &quot;Plasmodium falciparum PR2-10&quot;, shp = ZM_shp, year = 2010)</code></pre>
<p>Note that to use downloaded rasters and shapefiles directly with <code>autoplot()</code>, they must first be converted to usable rasters and shapefiles data frames, hence we use the <code>as.MAPraster()</code> and <code>as.MAPShp()</code> respectively.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ZMB_Pf &lt;- as.MAPraster(ZMB_Pf)
ZMB_shp_data &lt;- as.MAPshp(ZM_shp)
